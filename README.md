# website-examples

This repo contains the examples shown on the [genomespy.app](https://genomespy.app/) website.

You can also run and edit the examples locally by starting a web server such as the Python's [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):

```sh
python -m http.server
```
